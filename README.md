## Project Overview
This project is a desktop-based game built as part of the COMP 2522 course, developed using JavaFX. It utilizes **Java SDK 22**, **Maven** for project management and build automation, and **JUnit 5** for testing. Below, you'll find the steps to compile, run, and troubleshoot the project on both Windows and macOS.

## Requirements
- **Java SDK**: 22
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Test Framework**: JUnit 5
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA

## Project Setup

## Running the Game

### Using IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Navigate to the `HelloApplication.java` file (this is the entry point for the game).
2. In the top right corner of IntelliJ, click the **Run** button or press `Shift + F10` to compile and run the game.

### Using Maven (Command Line):
Alternatively, you can run the game using the following Maven commands:
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn javafx:run
```


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues, double-check your Maven setup and dependencies in pom.xml.
Or, like me, you might need to double-check your JAVA_HOME system variable path if prompted.
